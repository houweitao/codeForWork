WEST MEMPHIS, Ark. �� Sam Hawkins Jr. said he came to a rally here last week for the Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson because he finds Mr. Carson��s social conservatism appealing, relishes his newness to politics and believes that President Obama ��sold out for the vote�� in supporting same-sex marriage.

In other words, Mr. Hawkins resembles many of Mr. Carson��s supporters. That is, until he calls Bill Clinton ��my guy,�� notes that he voted for Mr. Obama, twice, and argues that the president has ��done a lot of positive stuff.��

Mr. Carson, a retired doctor who recently surged to first place in some national polls, is trying to solidify his lead in the volatile race for the Republican presidential nomination. To do so, his campaign is eyeing a group of voters who are traditionally scarce in Republican primaries but who could give him added support the other candidates are unlikely to draw: African-Americans, such as Mr. Hawkins.

��I��m just curious to see how this is going to play out,�� said Mr. Hawkins, a bail bondsman, of Mr. Carson��s candidacy. ��But right now, if he��s got my attention to have me here, that��s saying a whole lot.��

Mr. Carson has already been to Ferguson, Mo., and Baltimore this year �� sites of unrest after the police-related deaths of African-Americans �� as well as other black hubs such as Harlem. On Friday, his campaign will begin airing a rap-infused ad on black-oriented radio stations in several cities, and he will visit a youth center in Florida and speak to a black Republican club in the state. Later in the month, he is scheduled to attend a forum on criminal justice at the historically black Benedict College, in Columbia, S.C.

��He could do something for the country that has not been done for a long time: give American blacks an option in the primary,�� said Armstrong Williams, Mr. Carson��s closest adviser, referring to black voters�� habit of largely participating only in Democratic politics.

Yet if Mr. Carson��s potential for bringing black voters into the Republican primary illustrates a unique possibility, his efforts to win them over highlight his limitations as a candidate. Though he raised over $20 million during the third quarter of this year and primary votes will be cast in less than three months, his campaign operation has not caught up to his standing in the race. He has, for example, yet to hire a staff member dedicated to turning out black voters.

It is a position Mr. Carson will probably need to fill given the effort required to turn out voters with little history of participating in Republican primaries. There is profound skepticism among many blacks and whites that even somebody like Mr. Carson can break the seemingly cemented patterns of racial politics.

When the 2012 Republican primary race came to South Carolina, a state that is 28 percent black, just 1 percent of the voters were black, according to exit polls. That was a year in which there was no Democratic primary and in a state where voters can cast ballots in either party��s primary. Black participation was also 2 percent or less in Florida, Mississippi and Ohio, other states with significant black populations.

Even when black Republicans are on the ballot, little changes. ��History plays an important role,�� said Senator Tim Scott, a black Republican from South Carolina, explaining how it is difficult for Republicans to win black votes when they criticize, as Mr. Carson does, the same federal government that once delivered civil rights.

Mr. Scott��s support, for example, has come overwhelmingly from white voters: even while decisively winning his first election as an incumbent senator last year, he still lost many of the state��s heavily black counties to a black Democrat who spent only $74,000 on the race.

A celebrated neurosurgeon, Mr. Carson, 64, is a newcomer to politics but not to the consciousness of African-Americans. His up-from-poverty journey from a fatherless home in Detroit to the operating room of Johns Hopkins made him an icon long before he became a right-wing hero for inveighing against America��s ��moral decay�� at a 2013 prayer breakfast as President Obama sat watching. Mr. Carson��s autobiography, ��Gifted Hands,�� is recommended or required reading in many American middle schools.

��He��s not new to us, he��s just new to the country as a whole,�� said Kelly Price, a retired Army sergeant and community activist who drove from Tennessee to see Mr. Carson here. ��I��m excited about him.��

Mr. Price is a Republican but he brought a Democratic friend to the rally. Both recounted how Mr. Carson was a staple of Black History Month at school.

It is this fame that lured Dorcas Brazile and her daughter out on a Friday night to see Mr. Carson. Ms. Brazile, who is black, had read Mr. Carson��s book and watched the movie, starring Cuba Gooding Jr., about the doctor��s life; her 13-year-old daughter was assigned a school project on Mr. Carson a few years ago.

But if it was Mr. Carson��s celebrity that brought her, with her daughter, out �� ��I��m from West Memphis, Arkansas, we don��t have this chance often�� �� Ms. Brazile said she also liked what she heard.

��I��m a business owner and the taxes are very important,�� said Ms. Brazile, who owns a flower shop, adding that she would consider voting for Mr. Carson.

In interviews, she and other blacks said the same thing: that Mr. Obama��s election had removed a taboo and it would now be easier to elect black candidates in either party. But many black voters here said they had little affection for either party �� one woman who declined to share her name called herself a ��God-o-crat�� �� and, while praising his traditional values, were not ready to commit to Mr. Carson in the primary.

In a hard-fought campaign, adding new voters to the process who may be unreachable by other candidates could give Mr. Carson a crucial advantage. It could give him a lift not only in South Carolina, which votes third in the Republican race, but also in the Super Tuesday states casting ballots on March 1. Six Southern states, each with substantial black populations, vote that day.

��Even if you expanded the electorate by 2 or 3 percent, if it all came to you that would be a big difference in a 14-candidate field,�� said Barry Bennett, Mr. Carson��s campaign manager.

Given that the states voting before March 15 must allocate their delegates on a proportional basis, in many cases by congressional district, Mr. Bennett said the campaign was eyeing heavily black districts in such states, where adding just a few thousand voters could make a difference in delegates.

To this end, Mr. Carson is rolling out the radio ad, featuring the unlikely combination of rap rhythms by Aspiring Mogul and Mr. Carson��s soft-spoken stylings about ��the value of personal responsibility, hard work, creativity, innovation�� and how ��freedom is not free.�� It is to initially run in eight cities, five of which vote on March 1.

There is a long tradition, dating to at least Booker T. Washington, of the self-help gospel Mr. Carson preaches resonating with black Americans. Further, a sizable segment of blacks are culturally conservative, as is Mr. Carson.

��He has the same values that I do,�� said Louise Harris, a black retiree at the West Memphis rally, citing Mr. Carson��s vision for ��bringing our country back morally.��

But among blacks whose politics are not chiefly driven by this sort of focus on social issues, Mr. Carson faces a significant challenge: himself.

From his first encounter with the president, Mr. Carson has been harshly critical of the Obama administration, even likening the Affordable Care Act to Nazism.

��Take it from me, black people are only going to stomach so much criticism of their black president,�� said Tavis Smiley, a liberal commentator who has touched off anger for his critiques of Mr. Obama.

Compounding the challenge for Mr. Carson is that while much of his appeal centers on his being a political outsider, his lack of experience can be a detriment when it comes to the basics of elections.

Despite the money he has raised, he has not built a sophisticated organization. There is the lack of an aide, let alone a department, dedicated to turning out the black vote. (Some aides say it will happen, while others indicate they do not want to create such an infrastructure dedicated to black outreach.)

Ed Brookover, one of Mr. Carson��s top strategists, vowed ��a growing, visible effort�� to appeal to blacks in states with primaries open to all registered voters. But asked specific questions about South Carolina, a crucial early primary state, Mr. Brookover acknowledged that the campaign had not begun homing in on its targets.

��Our audience there may be African-Americans who have not been participating in Democratic politics,�� he said. ��But that��s speculation. We don��t have data on that yet.��

Mr. Carson does have a black woman, Marnie Robinson, working part-time on outreach to religious groups in South Carolina (she played the same role for Mr. Obama in 2008). But it is unclear how much she is engaging with the black church community. Eric Davis, the pastor of a nondenominational church in Columbia with 5,000 members, said he had not even known Ms. Robinson was working for Mr. Carson. As for the candidate himself, Mr. Davis said his congregants were ��watching to see if this is really real.��

And while the campaign planned to broadcast the radio ad in some states that do not plan to vote until March 15, it did not indicate whether it would air it in South Carolina, where the Republican primary is nearly a month earlier. Even the ad illustrates the campaign��s somewhat rudimentary nature: There is no mention of a website, let alone a social media address, where those interested in Mr. Carson can learn more about him or sign up to help.

There was also surprisingly little effort at the event in West Memphis, a heavily black town just across the Mississippi from the Tennessee city, to collect contact information from a mixed-race crowd of about 3,000 people who showed up from two states that will vote on March 1. There were placards to wave, but no sign of staff members asking attendees to fill out contact cards.

Nor was there anybody left from the staff to talk to Troy Bowens, a window cleaner from Memphis, when he dashed into the high school gym about the same time Mr. Carson was leaving. Mr. Bowens, who is black, said he knew of Mr. Carson long before the campaign because of his book �� ��Man, he��s made history, he came so far.�� He said he raced over to try to catch a glimpse after he saw a mention on the local TV news that the candidate was in the area.

He was visibly disappointed that he had missed a childhood hero.

��How come we just found this out?�� he asked.

chael Jordan was the best player of the 1990s by a truly massive margin. He's the greatest player in NBA history by a smaller, but still substantial, margin. No one ever approached him as a rival and came out ahead for more than a fleeting moment or two.

But one man did approach him as a partner and rose nearly to the level of His Airness for periods of time. One man did bolster Jordan's credentials by pushing the Chicago Bulls to six titles in eight years. And that man, of course, was Scottie Pippen.

Jordan's Bulls struggled in the playoffs until Phil Jackson and Pippen arrived. Chicago won its first title in Pippen's fourth season, as both he and MJ entered their primes. We've seen so many utility-knife small forwards come through the league, including LeBron James (the best of the type). Often, such a player is used to cover up the superstar's flaws. Jordan didn't have flaws, though, and all those Bulls teams really ever lacked was big man scoring.

"PIPPEN WAS THE SECOND BEST PLAYER IN THE LEAGUE THROUGH THE '90S."
Pippen wasn't the type to simply handle dirty work on behalf of Jordan. He was a hero unto himself, a master passer, scorer, rebounder and a superior defender to even His Airness. In fact, it's likely Pippen was better than Jordan in every category other than scoring/shooting. Admittedly, that's an important piece of basketball. But to star next to the best player ever and one-up him in key aspects of the game repeatedly? That says something major about Pippen's excellence.

Only one of Pippen's post-Bulls seasons -- 1998-99 with the Rockets -- is captured in this decade, leaving out his powerful run with the Blazers. That success in the early-'00s, which included a near title in 2000 as Portland was inches from beating the Lakers in the West finals, proved what many knew to be true: Pippen was the second best player in the league through the '90s.

We've talked about Jordan and Pippen. Here are 13 more awesome players from that decade.

FIRST TEAM

Hakeem Olajuwon

The Dream was our third team center for the '80s, and he was pretty clearly No. 1 for the '90s. He famously led the Rockets to back-to-back titles in MJ's absence, trumping Patrick Ewing's Knicks and Shaquille O'Neal's Magic, winning Finals MVP both years. He won the league MVP in 1994, and back-to-back Defensive Player of the Year awards as well. Olajuwon was essentially the league's best player as soon as Jordan retired the first time -- he was at his peak while Pippen was still climbing. Olajuwon slid toward the end of the 90s, but he was without question the best center of the decade.

Scottie Pippen

See above.

Karl Malone

Malone nearly made our All-'80s team; there's no question he belongs high on the All-'90s squad. The question is where he belongs in relation to Charles Barkley given Pippen's claim on one first-team forward spot. Malone's pretty clearly the answer after you look at the honors each earned and the numbers. The Mailman won two MVPs in the decade to Barkley's one. He was First-Team All-NBA all 10 years of the '90s. Barkley nabbed three such honors. In addition to his two MVPs, Malone had five top-5 MVP finishes in the decade. Barkley had two. Sir Charles finished his career ranked No. 29 on the all-time NBA/ABA scoring list. Malone is, of course, No. 2. Barkley is much preferred in retirement; on the floor, Malone was better.

Michael Jordan

No explanation required.

John Stockton

Like his partner, Stockton nearly made the '80s team. Instead, he's an obvious first-team selection for the '90s as the best point guard of the decade. What's interesting is that at no point was Stockton ever considered one of the best players in the league. He never finished higher than seventh in MVP voting, and landed in the top-10 only twice in the '90s. But he was the consummate point guard and paired with Malone so incredibly that everyone still knew what he brought to the table. It can be argued that Malone's pair of MVPs were nods to Stockton's excellence as well. Stockton was a nasty, little defender, landing on four Second-Team All-Defenses along with a couple of first team All-NBAs and a bevy of lower honors.

SECOND TEAM

Shaquille O'Neal

Shaq was a phenom for the first part of the '90s, a megastar for the latter half and somehow got better in the '00s. Diesel debuted in 1992 and had the Magic in the playoffs by Year 2, in the Finals by Year 3 and heartbroken by Year 5. In L.A. he continued his reign, though his greatest individual and team successes came in 2000 and beyond. As it is, in the '90s Shaq had a scoring title, a string of All-Star nods and spots on the All-NBA teams every season. He also knocked on the MVP door quite a bit before winning his only one in 2000. This included a No. 7 finish as a rookie and a No. 2 finish to Hakeem in 1995.

Charles Barkley

See Karl Malone's entry.

Tim Duncan

Yes, I'm giving Duncan the second-team All-'90s nod off two seasons. He had teams tanking for him in 1997, and the Spurs got lucky. Duncan had led them to a championship by 1999. And that wasn't just any title run, it was perhaps the second-most dominant title run ever as Duncan led to the Spurs to a 15-2 record. Duncan was the Finals MVP a year after being the Rookie of the Year (a year after being the unanimous College Player of the Year). He actually finished third in MVP voting in 1999 in an extraordinarily tight race with Malone and Alonzo Mourning. In 1998, he landed on the All-Rookie, All-NBA and All-Defense teams. He was one of the few unanimous No. 1 overall picks (the first since Shaq and last before LeBron) who immediately lived up to all of the hype and began delivering on Day 1. And while two seasons is a light record to put him into the All-'90s team, the other forward options below him were clearly inferior.

PROFESSOR FLANNERY: With the exception of David Robinson over Shaq for second-team center, which is splitting hairs, Ziller and I are in lock-step on every other selection for the first and second team. Except for this one. Dennis Rodman was a cartoon villain and often a caricature of himself throughout most of the '90s, but he was also the best rebounder of his generation (if not ever), a great defender and a key contributor on four championship teams during the decade (five overall), including one of the best teams of all time. Tim Duncan was, is and will always be one of the greatest of all time, but considering the balance of the '90s, Rodman was more impactful.

Clyde Drexler

Drexler led the Blazers to the Finals in 1990 and 1992, won a title with Hakeem in 1995, and was considered the second best shooting guard for at least the first half of the decade. He was a four-time All-Star starter in the '90s and made one First-Team All-NBA with a few lower honors. He also finished No. 2 to Jordan in 1992 MVP voting after a masterful 25-6-6 season. That campaign was in some ways Portland's last gasp, and MJ and Pippen snuffed the Blazers out in the Finals. Portland got punked out in the first round the following year, and midway through the '94-95 season, Drexler was shipped to Houston, where he had some good years and won that elusive title.

Reggie Miller

Miller was the successor to Drexler on the Not-Jordan-But-Still-Damn-Good level of shooting guards. He was, more importantly, the first lights-out three-point shooter in the league, a man known almost exclusively for his exploits beyond the arc. By his fifth season (1992), 30 percent of his shots taken were from beyond the arc; he got as high as 43 percent for a few seasons. In the modern game, that wouldn't be particularly noteworthy. In the '90s it was unheard of. He was deadly efficient from deep, and it's pretty amazing that despite the three gaining in use and importance at a rapid speed in the 2000s, Miller is still No. 2 all-time (behind Ray Allen) in makes. In terms of individual honors, he was never remotely in any MVP conversation, but he made four All-Star Games and three Third-Team All-NBAs in the '90s.

THIRD TEAM

David Robinson

He was Hakeem's Drexler for the bulk of the '90s, if that makes sense. Is it wrong to think that the most important thing that The Admiral -- who won a Rookie of the Year, a Defensive Player of the Year and a freaking MVP -- did for the Spurs was getting hurt in 1996-97, because that helped bring Duncan and dynasty? For what it's worth, Robinson could easily be above Shaq based on the 1999 title and his defensive prowess. Shaq just felt so much more important and ... good.

Grant Hill

Hill's career is considered a disappointment because injuries robbed him of his prime, but we tend to forget why those injuries were so unfortunate: he was really damn good early on! While Hill's Detroit never had much playoff success, he starred as a Swiss Army Knife in the Pippen mold, racking up All-NBA nods and finishing No. 3 in 1997 MVP voting (far) behind Malone and Jordan.

FLANNERY: For the record, my third-team forwards were Shawn Kemp and Detlef Schrempf. The Reign Man's legend is still strong, but we'd do well to remember that Schrempf averaged 17 points, 7 rebounds and four assists throughout the '90s, while being incredibly durable and posting a True Shooting Percentage of .598. He was a three-time All-Star and twice named Sixth Man of the Year. Hill was incredible over the second half of the '90s and his injuries didn't mount until the aughts, but Schrempf's prime simply lasted longer.

Dennis Rodman

The best rebounder of all time. The most, uh, interesting character in modern basketball history. A five-time champion (four in the '90s). He won the first two DPOYs of the decade and made two All-Star teams, even. Going back to 1989, he appeared on an All-Defense team eight straight years. Critical piece of the Bad Boys and the second Jordan three-peat squad. Completely untenable on 29 of the 30 teams at any given point.

Gary Payton

The Glove was an absolute workhorse -- he missed only two games in the entire 1990s. He was one versatile man, too: in addition to his famous defense, he moonlighted as a Reggian shooter in 1999-2000, leading the league in threes attempted and made plus racking up the most assists. (Yes, that's outside the 1990s. Just adding some flavor to the Payton story.) In the '90s, Payton had the masterful Finals run in 1996 plus a few years where Seattle looked like the absolute future. He was the 1996 DPOY and a perennial All-Star. And he eventually got his title in the 2000s ...

Mitch Richmond

Homer alert. I don't care. Here in Northern California, we frequently argued that Rock -- not Drexler or Miller -- was the league's second-best shooting guard. Richmond made six straight All-Star teams in the '90s and was named All-Star MVP in 1995, which was actually the best moment for Sacramento fans to that point in the decade. The Kings' brief playoff run in 1996 was the next and final high point for Richmond's Hall of Fame stay in Sactown: The Kings peeled one game off of the brilliant Sonics. Richmond hung 37 points on Seattle in Game 2, tying the series and setting up what is the greatest crowd I've ever seen through the TV screen for Game 3. (The Kings lost that and the series. Oh well.) I'd be willing to hear cases for Kevin Johnson, Tim Hardaway and Glen Rice here if it weren't my first opportunity to get a King on a list.

FLANNERY: You're a homer. It should be Hardaway.

HONORABLE MENTIONS

Patrick Ewing, Shawn Kemp, Isiah Thomas, Detlef Schrempf, Horace Grant, Kevin Johnson, Tim Hardaway, Alonzo Mourning, Joe Dumars, Glen Rice, Dikembe Mutombo, Chris Mullin, Penny Hardaway, Brad Daugherty, Kevin Garnett, Chris Webber, Vin Baker, Rod Strickland, Larry Johnson.

A FEW WORDS FROM FLANNERY ABOUT PATRICK EWING

The '90s belonged to the Chicago Bulls, but for every dominant team there must be a loser and so the decade was also marked by a long line of tragic figures. The ��91 Bulls ended the Pistons and Lakers hold on the league and subsequent championship seasons denied the Blazers, Suns, Sonics and Jazz from reaching the summit. That, in turn, kept Clyde Drexler, Charles Barkley, Shawn Kemp, Gary Payton, Karl Malone and John Stockton from championship validation in their prime. (Drexler and Payton won rings with other teams.)

The Bulls also lorded over the East as they repeatedly turned back the Cavs and Pacers during their run and dealt the Shaq-Penny Magic a death blow a year after Orlando became the last team to beat Michael Jordan in the playoffs. So many players and teams lived in Jordan's shadow during this decade, but none bore the marks of defeat more critically than Patrick Ewing and his star-crossed Knicks.

The Bulls swept New York in 1991 en route to their first title. They beat them in seven games in the second round the following year and in six during the 1993 conference finals. Few teams challenged Chicago like those Knicks, but challenging and defeating are two separate things. It wasn't until Jordan retired for the first time that the Knicks finally broke through in 1994, beating a Jordan-less Bulls squad in the conference semifinals. In keeping with their unfortunate legacy, they eventually lost in the Finals to Hakeem's Rockets.

With a brutalist defense as their calling card, the '90s Knicks were the logical extension of the Bad Boy Pistons, but without the offensive firepower or depth to carry them across the finish line. They had characters like Oak and Mase and Starks, but in the middle of all this was Ewing, the great center who in the context of his era was merely very, very good.

Ewing did not make our All-'90s team and it would be difficult, although not impossible, to make a case for him above Olajuwon, David Robinson or Shaq. That does nothing to diminish his accomplishments: eleven All-Star selections, six top-5 MVP finishes, six All-NBA Second-Teams and one First-Team nod in addition to two gold medals, a national championship and three Final Fours in his four years at Georgetown during his Hall of Fame career.

He arrived in New York with a challenge to revitalize the game in its adopted capital and create a legend that would parallel the achievements of Bill Russell and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. He accomplished the first, but came up short on the second. In another time and another place, Patrick Ewing would be remembered for what he did and not what he couldn't quite grasp.


There are moments when you sit agape with wonder, pondering whether anything is impossible for Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors.

As Curry pulls up from 26 feet and swishes another jumper, you wonder whether he's actually the best player in the league now and for years to come. Whether he's better than LeBron, better than Durant, better than Davis. As the Warriors toy with yet another good opponent and win again, you wonder whether 73-9 is possible. As Golden State bludgeons its first four opponents by a combined 100 points and ends the Clippers' undefeated start, you wonder whether this is already a young dynasty getting fitted for a fistful of rings.

It's impossible to keep perspective on Curry and the Warriors while you're watching them because nothing seems impossible. Curry sitting for the bulk of the first quarter due to foul trouble seemed like a jape, like Luke Walton turned the difficulty level from "normal" to "hard." L.A. effectively attacked Curry with Chris Paul and screening action, and it served its purpose early. But it just delayed the inevitable. Any victory over this team only delays the inevitable. Ask the Grizzlies, Rockets and Cavaliers about last spring. You do exactly what you set out to do, you succeed and they erase your victory with a snap of their fingers.

The Warriors have flaws. Curry is an improved defender, but he's still relatively thin and can be backed down. CP3 took advantage of that early. The Clippers forced doubles to work Curry, and CP3 finished the first half with 20 points. The Warriors found a way around it. (Notably, by attacking the short Paul and getting him into third quarter foul trouble. That prevented Paul from keeping the pressure on Curry and foul trouble was no longer an issue for Steph.)

Draymond Green and Harrison Barnes can be erratic, and both Curry and Klay Thompson can take wild shots. Some of Walton's substitution decisions were head-scratchers, understandable given his inexperience. But Golden State is otherwise so damn efficient on both ends that it's all of little concern in the macro view.Their advantages elsewhere are so great as to nearly always make those flaws irrelevant.

The Clippers appear at times uniquely suited to topple the Warriors. In CP3 they have one of the point guards best poised to punish Curry on one end and disrupt him on the other. In Blake Griffin they have one of the few power forwards in the West who can keep Draymond Green on his heels. In DeAndre Jordan they have a center who can control the boards on both ends if the Warriors go small, and who can finish cleanly when help defenders abandon him to chase Paul. (In theory, he's also agile enough to switch out and challenge those Curry jumpers. It didn't happen on Wednesday: he guarded against the drive, which is the opposite of what you want to do against Steph.) L.A. has a coach who masterfully works the referees, and they have a gunner in J.J. Redick who could challenge Curry in an empty-gym shooting contest. The pieces are there.

But then you see the Warriors swallow the Clippers' confidence alive in the closing minutes of a November game and that thought slips away.

L.A. can build on this defeat to better challenge Golden State the next time around. It has the comfort of knowing it was the last team to beat the Warriors in a playoff series. There will be chances back at home, although Doc Rivers still needs to discover how best to use Lance Stephenson and Paul Pierce in the fourth quarter. (Notably, Rivers ran with his son in crunch time until Austin fouled out. His defense was good, and he made some nice cuts to get free, but you have to believe there's more upside in having Pierce or Stephenson out there. Coach Rivers has earned the benefit of the doubt, but these are tricky waters, especially with someone as notoriously immature as Lance.)

You also wonder if at some point the Warriors will have an injury that actually hurts the team. As David Lee's malady allowed Green to blossom into a star last season, Andrew Bogut's prolonged absence due to a concussion has given Festus Ezeli time to shine. The Warriors might be better with Ezeli than Bogut. (In fact, Walton may have to think twice about re-inserting Bogut into the starting lineup once he's healthy.)

While Golden State's brilliant depth gives them options everywhere, their famous health has posed few real rotational challenges that seemingly ever other contender deals with constantly. We haven't actually seen the Warriors respond to the "hard" difficulty setting yet. We don't know how well they'll do when everything isn't perfect.

This is all after-the-fact rationalization, of course. We want to keep perspective and not fall head-over-heels for this squad lest we bump our domes and tumble. We'll search out the flaws, however trivial they are. Only when removed from watching their magic can we justify doubt.

And yet, Curry and the Warriors seem incapable of disappointing us, of falling short of whatever insane expectations we list. Golden State quarters no skepticism in its play, and meets every challenge thrown in its path. That's all the Warriors can do, really. If we don't believe in their infallibility now, there's nothing but time that will change our minds. Not when they play like this.
